MON 
still not doing well with assignments...I need to figure out where the disconnect is
I have been thinking of dynamic qualities that could improved as we are discussing theDOM  and jquery
jquery is a wonderful thing
starting to finally get into the swing of these assignments
spending still too much time on trying to do everything exactly the way it states
and this sort of learning cant move at that speed and hope to be retained 
looking forward to the rest of the week.

I must admit that the observation, in and of itself, is one of great irony.  
Meaningful conversation certainly may be the reason some ppl tend to gravitate towards one another or feel safe in a larger group of their peers, etc. But, I think we are all starting to reach out to one another a little more, or maybe it’s that we are becoming simply more familiar with one another.


It is really hard to not be good at something in the onset...I’m usually able to pick up new skills fairly quick b/c I have good mental recall of how it looked to be performed, or what analogy was invoked to make sense of the whole mess.
 
I had a breakthrough with GitHub, I do not know why I was having such a disconnect with GitHub, but it took a little detective work.

Github help-
Al_the_X sat down and went through it with me, cleared a lot up..He suggested I sit with someone and go over it again and Jon C. offered to help me..he really couldn’t have been more
helpful all the while not making feel like moe-ron jack wagon numb skull Ima tryan ta think but nuttens happin -botched lobotomy
Now I feel 100 times better about setting up the assignments...and I feel confident that I’m making it work for me rather than counter to my purposes.
ITEMS -Concepts- RULES- Definitions…..TO STUDY
