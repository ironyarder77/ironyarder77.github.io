**JOURNAL WEEK 3 **
Mon
Well it was a bit of a releif to move on to CSS..
There are so many attractive things about the amount of spatial control that you can have over elements when using
CSS, but it is definitely not an intuitive interface...at least for me.
The manipulation of borders, margins, text boxes, image wraps (wrapping text around images)..were a lot easier to manipulate in Quark for instance.

Still having difficulty wrapping my head around why my work is not making it to the TA.
There is a disconnect that I'm trying to locate that would really help pull it together.
I think my main confusion stems from this.
I know from working in print, on the web, and in the app store, that my strength lies in graphic design work--meaning I rarely touched the code...I need to know how to do both in order to make the app what it needs to be.  I am using new tools..which reminds me..It seems like quark style sheets were a lot easier to manipulate text and image boxes or divs or containers ...such an amazing piece of software. It's is a shame that industry is more concerned with **"new" and "now"** rather than **"tried" and "true"**..but CSS is NOT THE ENEMY it's apples and oranges..actually not even..you could implement CSS within Quark I'm sure...anyway I like it....I'm still in culture shock from not being the expert at what I do every day...and it's just been a long time since I learned something in an academic environment. I just need to keep at it and get more familiar and not approach this with the premptive anxiety I had the first week.

I am definitely enjoying CSS and I know that it will become a great tool the more I use it. It is nice to 
see things actualizing on the screen...The excercises are very good but I need to get caught up or return to them rather.
I find it curious that css makes it so difficult and counter intuitive to work along an x y axis.
  
Things are looking better and I am getting a little more comfortable. 
thur-wondering when we are going to start talking a little more about working on final projects: what it entails, are there any submissions yet (most likely not). just curious how it will develop. I am focusing on the electronic authentication that Terry is licensing to Appcellerator..I need to find out which part of it could be applied to the onboard systems of either the 3Dr Iris or the DJI Vision version3+...Although I don't think DJI is the best company to focus on regarding sponsorship of a project here. It would bring a lot of attn. even if it was Syma
I'm having to re-learn page orientation with new terms, new tools, new everything..and I have to say it is way less flexible than what I am used to but I just need time wtih it..THATS ALL...as for learning knew software like GitHub or learning a new skill set..is for me,...something that takes time and persistence. The more I'm exposed to new skills the more I will be able to understand...and the more I pracitice the sharper get until most of what is hanging me up now is routine.
DEMO DAY PROJECTS...very curious about how we are going to start dealing with this- what it entails: are there any submissions yet? (most likely not). just curious how it will develop.

Here some notes from the week:
3 rules of any cascade:
  1. Inheritance - some properties are inherited by the children

  2. Specificity - if you increase specificity you can override inheritance, use more selectors or different selectors

  3. Order - based on the entire rule, top to bottom, earlier rules get clobbered by later properties

THIS IS A GOOD PROCESS CHECKLIST
1. Read the assignment

2. New Issue (name it and paste the checklist into the description)

3. Merge PRs

4. Create new branches

5. Make changes, minimal first

6. Open new PR for each Repo being altered

7. Paste link to PR in Issue
