JOURNAL WEEK 3 
Well it was a bit of a releif to move on to CSS but difficult to become reaquainted for sure. I have dabbled in CSS in order to change small attributes: color, font size, etc. but never this extensively
There are so many attractive things about the amount of spatial control that you can have over elements when using
CSS, but it is definitely not an intuitive interface...at least for me.
The manipulation of borders, margins, text boxes, image wraps (wrapping text around images)..this is 
ALL stuff that was handled expertly by DreamWeaver and I believe, Quark, and also by Photoshop if you were creative enough to re-appropriate certain tools like the Free Transform.
Tue-Still having difficulty wrapping my head around why my work is not making it to the TA.
There is a disconnect that I'm trying to locate that would really help pull it together.
I think my main confusion stems from this.
I was not accurately informed about what I was supposed to have known as a baseline for this course.
My instructor reminded me that what skills I do have are out of date..although I do have a background in fine art
and I know, from being published in print, on the web, and in the app store, that my strength lies in design work.
Quark, for instance,  was such an amazing piece of software. it is a shame that the industry is more concerned with new than they are with "now".
I am definitely liking learning about CSS and I know that it will become a great tool the more I use it.
I find it curious that css makes it so difficult and counter intuitive to work along an x y axis.
This types of html elements were so much more flexible with other software I've used in the past.
Thu-I would like to have had more prep time for all of this. The advice to read Eloquent Javascript has not helped lol.  

Things are looking better and I am getting a little more comfortable. I've never been this low on the totem pole and that in and of itself has been a real challenge to overcome.
thur-wondering when we are going to start talking a little more about working on final projects: what it entails, are there any submissions yet (most likely not). just curious how it will develop.
I'm having to re-learn page orientation with new terms, new tools, new everything..and I have to say it is way less flexible than what I am used to but I just need time wtih it..THATS ALL...as for learning knew software like GitHub or learning a new skill set..is for me,...something that takes time and persistence. The more I'm exposed to new skills the more I will be able to understand...and the more I pracitice the sharper get until most of what is hanging me up now is routine.

Here some notes from the week:
3 rules of any cascade:
  1. Inheritance - some properties are inherited by the children

  2. Specificity - if you increase specificity you can override inheritance, use more selectors or different selectors

  3. Order - based on the entire rule, top to bottom, earlier rules get clobbered by later properties



THIS IS A GOOD PROCESS CHECKLIST
1. Read the assignment

2. New Issue (name it and paste the checklist into the description)

3. Merge PRs

4. Create new branches

5. Make changes, minimal first

6. Open new PR for each Repo being altered

7. Paste link to PR in Issue
