Github help-
Al_the_X sat down and went through it with me, cleared a lot up..He suggested I sit with someone and go over it again and Jon C. offered to help me..he really couldn’t have been more
helpful all the while not making feel like moe-ron jack wagon numb skull Ima tryan ta think but nuttens happin -botched lobotomy
Now I feel 100 times better about setting up the assignments...and I feel confident that I’m making it work for me rather than counter to my purposes.
