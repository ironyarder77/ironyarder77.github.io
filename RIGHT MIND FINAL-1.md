<h>*The Right Mindset: Reflections on Carol Dweck's Motivation Research & The Power of "Yet"*</h>
<body>
<p>This essay explains and explores the "Growth Mindset " and the "Power of Yet" , two inter-related concepts articulated by Carol Dweck.  These concepts were extrapolated from years of field research at various public schools around the nation. The overall concept of adopting a "non-fixed" or fluid, adaptive mindset which is rewarded and replenished simply by discovery rather than a "fixed", rigid frame of mind approach. This was formulated, coined you could say, studied and extrapolated by Stanford Researcher, Carol Dweck. 
The "Yet" concept came about while Carol Dweck was observing a children in a Chicago inner city school, that had to complete a certain number of classes before they could graduate.  And instead 
instead of students receiving an "F" upon making a failing grade, the Instructor would write "Not Yet".
Taken by this positive comment on progress, she formed a research project around the idea and her results were startling.</p>
<p>The Stanford researcher's subjects were elementary school children from failing school systems, 
some sub-standard, like a school in the Bronx, NY, children living on a Washington State Reservation, and groups who have unfortunately acquired the socio-academic stigma of being "under achievers" or inherently cut off from higher learning by an expectation of failure. In all these examples the students' scores vastly improved when the testing material was nested in a learning process instead of a hard pass or fail system.  Early on the study found that some of the children, when presented with the researchers' plan to intensify the difficulty, rejected the challenge, and even said they would cheat if they could.  However some reacted with a more positive genuine hunger to learn and approached the tests with more vigor.  When I was researching this it took me back to my Iron Yard interview when I was presented with a type of logic or critical thinking test, nothing big, but I could see it having polarizing effects.  I could see how some would feel so intimidated that they might even be angry or agitated.
I do love these types of tests, and this was a good one.  I had a couple of seconds of feeling caught off guard but was almost immediately in awe of its simplicity and its certain level of complexity: revealing more about the tester than focusing on the "right answer".</p>

<p>The "yet" concept can be used to describe a certain way of positive reinforcement devoid of finite labels such as "Fail". A categorical "Failure" in the "Yet", or "growth" mindset, suddenly becomes "Not successful yet".   Instead, children were told that if they keep practicing what they are learning. math skills. For instance, their brains would become stronger, developing new neurons and producing brain cells, regardless of a persons age.  This only brought more enthusiasm to their hunger "to know".
This psychologically transmits to the student that learning is a process of confronting unfamiliar territory, 
experimenting with ways of illuminating the situation, struggling with the unfamiliar, but all the while 
approaching it not with fear or pre-emptive anxiety, but with the joy of confronting an exciting challenge. 
A challenge, who's outcome does not set the child's ego and self down a negative path.</p>

<p>It is comforting to think this concept seems to be latching on to our  educators.  From what we have experienced with our daughter it seems to be taking the place of the outdated performance based system of judgement where the ultimate goal seems to be some unrealistic ideal for increasing or, at least, sustained success.
The TED talk really spoke to me since I too am now in the student seat.The TED talk was a very comforting reminder that learning and the acquisition of knowledge is a journey, not a series of empirical testing and prize seeking or ego bloating for that matter.  I am nowhere near where I need to be but I am basing that on where _I_ think I need to be.  Everyone has their own arc, and as long as you work hard and embrace challenges that may take you down a few notches but in the end make all the difference.  After all, great works of sculpture are created by the cracking, breaking, cutting, chiseling off of rock or other parent matter. It is the hits, the challenges, the times we get knocked down in the process that are the recipe for greatness. The beauty of the relief is apparent only after the material has almost been destroyed or so altered in form that it no longer even resembles its former self.</p>

<p>I found this assignment to be not only interesting from a scientific investigation standpoint, but from a personal standpoint as well.  It has been an inspirational point of reference for me at certain times since beginning my time at the Iron Yard. I have found myself echoing the mantra of "not yet".  There is an irony in the learning process, probably many to be sure. Every day as I learn new concepts and terms, I am constantly reminded of all that I don't know. This can be a stressful realization, as if that wasn't enough that stress is compounded  by such a profound influx of informational stimuli.  It is more than possible to actually feel as if you are losing ground, not gaining.  It has been a challenge to stay inside the right mindset. But, having this assignment has been a much needed reminder to not be so vigilantly hard on myself and give myself a chance to un-learn and re-learn  a completely new sea of knowledge.  I'm not a developer, not yet, but I will be.</p>
