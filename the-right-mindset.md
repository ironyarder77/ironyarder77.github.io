```-N TITLE OK BUT NEED TO RE-WORK OUTLINE- TOO TANGENTIAL AND LACKING FOCUS.```

<body>
```-N PARAGRAPHS SEEM TO BE OUT OF ORDER AND THE THERE IS A LOT OF SUPERFULOUS WORDING. FIX THIS TOO TANGENTIAL AND LACKING FOCUS.```

<p1>The concept of adopting a "non-fixed" or fluid, adaptive mindset which is rewarded and replenished simply by discovery rather than a "fixed", rigid frame of mind, which only works for material reward or ego inflation was formulated, coined you could say, studied and extrapolated by Stanford Researcher, Carol Dweck, aka "the mindset lady" as "Yet thinking".
The "Yet" concept came about while Carol Dweck was observing a schoolroom, where, 
instead of students receiving an "F" upon making a failing grade, the teacher would write "Not Yet". </p1>

<p2>This psychologically transmits to the student that learning is a process of confronting unfamiliar territory, 
experimenting with ways of illuminating the situation, struggling with the unfamiliar, but all the while 
approaching it not with fear or pre-emptive anxiety, but with the joy of confronting an exciting challenge. 
A challenge, who's outcome does not set the child's ego and self down a negative path.</p2>

<p3>The Stanford researcher's subjects were elementary school children from failing school systems, 
some substandard schools, such as a school in the Bronx, NY, and groups who have unfortunately acquired the 
socio-academic stigma of being "under achievers" or inherently cut off from higher learning by an expectation of 
failure. The "yet" concept is used to describe a certain way of positive reinforcement devoid of finite labels 
such as "Fail". Instead, children were told that if they keep practicing what they are learning. math skills, 
for instance, their brains, although initially terrified of the challenges, begins to actually develop new pathways
of growth.</p3>
```_-N DONT FORGET TO REFERENCE THE KAHN YOUTUBE VIDEO ETC.  LOOP IT BACK IN._```



<p4>I am very familiar with this concept in my own life. As parents, my wife and I have always taken this approach with our daughter Lola. One of the reasons we moved to Orange county is b/c of a particularly good school in an above average school _district_. It is not abnormal for both parents of a single family household to each hold at least one post graduate degree.  In short, there is an untold amount of pressure placed on the children attending some of the better schools.  Theese schools seem to be better funded and from what we have experienced they still do put a certain amountof pressure on the kids as well.  
To our credit we made a conscious decision to not put any undue pressure on our daughter. We do praise her like any overly enamored parent would, but we also continually and conciously try to convey a similar philosophy to her, which is essentially the "Yet" concept.</p>

```_**-N AND AGAIN HERE.**_```


<p>My personal experiences have been less ideallyic and it would probably not be much of a shock to most from my generation that our parents, especially our fathers would have labeled this nothing short of social heresy.
However, we do see a world obsessed with their performance based on the peerformance of others or the potential monetary award for a lifetime of hard work and dilligence.  And at what expense have we been so eager to chase after "the A+" figuratively speaking, and if we don't achieve it, we conisder ourselves and anyone else in the same circumstance as anyting short of unfortunate. It is refreshing to think about this concept is latching on to our childrens' educators.  From what we have experienced with our daughter it seems to be taking the place of the outdated performanced based system of judgement where the ultimate goal seems to be some unrealistic ideal for success.</p>

<p>The TED talk really spoke to me since I too am now in the student seat. I, like most, have had a tendency from time to time to compare my progress or level of understanding to that of my fellow classmates.  The TED talk was a very comforting reminder that learning and the acquisition of knowledge is a journey, not a series of empirical testing and prize seeking or ego bloating for that matter.  I am nowhere near where I need to be but I am basing that on where _I_ think I need to be.  Everyone has their own arc, and as long as you work hard and embrace challenges that may take you down a few notches but in the end make all the difference.  After all, great works of sculpture are created by the cracking, breaking, cutting, chiseling off of rock or other parent matter. It is the hits, the challenges, the times we get knocked down in the process that are the recipe for greatness. The beauty of the relief is apparent only after the material has almost been  destroyed or so altered in form that it no longer even resembles its former self.</p>
``` -N _**SAMURAI SWORD FORGING MAY BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF STRENGTH THROUGH BUT IT IS NOT ANALOGOUS TTO THE CONCEPTS BEING DESCRIBED HERE.**_***REPLACE***```
 
``` -N _**IT IT IN FACT IS USED TO REMIND THE READER THAT BEAUTY AND STRENGTH ARE SOMETIMESDERIVED FROM WITHSTANDING CHALLENGING LIFE-SITUATIONS...... IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO DRAW A COMPARISON TO THE INITIAL BRAIN TEASER TEASER TEST THAT KELLY GAVE ME AT THE END OF MY 2ND INTERVIEW: IT ACTUALLY WAS A CONFIDENCE BUILDER FOR ME.**_I FELT ENCOURAGED BY IT AND I STILL THINK OF IT**_```

<p>Samurai swords were once made (and the best ones still are made)by heating up metals and repeatedly molding them into a small square, which is then beaten and folded over 5,000 times before it is ready to be permently cast as what we know as a Samurai Sword.  With each hammering, the sword master, usually with the help of his apprentice, literally beat it to a pulp with very large mallet like hammers,.  </p>
The ideas present in Carol Dweck's "Yet" concept and "Yet" mindset have genuinely helped me in just the last 2 days by reminding me of the bigger picture: That I am at the Iron Yard for me, for my own intellectual curiosity, my own personal and, of course, professional development. I can plainly see now that we, in cohort 5, are like those Samurai swords, getting burned, scorched, melted, beaten, folded, and re-heated, over and over until something truly wonderful is realized and then injected back into the world.
