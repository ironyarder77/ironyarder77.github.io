Journal week 2 
MONDAY
//I usually prefer to write long hand when I'm writing more steam of conciousness, like this or any journal.
//So I am copying these from the original entries in my notebook.
//I will make entries 
For me it is where I'm spending most of my weekends, It's the first thing I think about in the morning. And definitely some of the mornings last week met me with a "stunned" feeling. 
Taking in even more information. I feel like I am catching up. It is ver frustrating that I have had such a hard time 
NOT getting scattered while working with the old github. Today was a different type of day for obvious reasons but I'm using the time to go through more exercises.

TUESDAY
Today we were back at it. David was back from moving his family from Florida.
I am feeling better about things. It reminds me of when I moved to spain when I was 17.
Basically, it took me only one night out trying to communicate with ppl at a bar, to realize that all the years prior
I had taken self expression for granted. It took me a couple of weeks before I felt natural about communicating and not contemplating every word. It was a microcosmic version of this or vice versa. I would spend so much time struggling for the perfect or acurate word instead of putting actually conveyance of meaning the main goal.
It WILL happen with this too but It needs to be a lot sooner.

WEDNESDAY
I'm definitely having some issue with understanding how to setup for these assignments. I need to step back and get
a larger perspective from time to time.
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT I TRY EVERY SECTION AND DRILL THE GIT STATUS, GIT ADD, GIT COMMIT, GIT PUSH, and make sure
It is actually going where it is supposed to.
Wrote my Instructor to apologize for being late and I accidentally posted it on the FEE channel so everyone saw it or rather everyone could have seen it. Oy. And if that wasn't enough I said the words you never want to say when you are referring pledging to never let some infraction take place again: I will never let this happen again. good move Matt don't you know that Always seems to signal the universe to actually make that very thing happen? lol

THURSDAY
today was pretty horrible all around. Well except for one thing.So...as it goes I wake up and my car is DEAD....DEAD..battery? starter?..I called triple AAA..and this is after I had to wait on top of the parking garage the 2nd day of class b/c AAA to help me (lack of perm plates.)  So I had to call a tow company and sit there and wait and wait...it gave me plenty of time to imagine the face of the person who was going to over charge me for roadside assistance. He was actually a nice guy...but it took him forever to realize it was my starter..so now I had to get it repaired...AND I still needed to get my plates...I've been driving to school everyday with my title and tags narrowly avoiding capture....Anyway I made it in...I was pretty certain my Instructor was going to write me off completely or just be so irritated that he would just not even look at me...even though it couldnve have happened to anyone.....it didn't it happened to me only one day after pissing him off for being 2 minutes tardy.
I had to face the music and walk in there like a jerk, take my lumps, and move on...but something else happened
he gave me a supportive sorta hug/slap on the back..like a coach would...it's all I needed to get back in the rhythm ..maybe he figured that after all that it would be the last thing to literally break me..lol
Anyway it was really really cool.
He didn't say another word about it and neither did I but you better  believe I was early on Friday
FRIDAY
Felt better today about HW but I am really struggling with GitHub..I need to ask David to help me.
I really think thats my biggest problem at this point.
I was really proud of my Right Mind Set essay but I don't think anyone ever read it...I may put it in my iron yard dedicated twitter feed
