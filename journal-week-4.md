**Journal week 4**
_Ancient proverb_
If the mountain becomes invisible 
It doesn't mean that it is hollow
Or that you can, just like, walk through it...

**Week 4**
Very rough- hanging there - I've realized that I have so much much more js to learn than I even realized --im still taking tutorials -anything to lessen the gap between what I know (which is little) and what I don't know( which is rather big).

I am learning a lot from others as they are as generous with their time, explanations, encouraging words, and even the occasional smile-- as they can humanly and sanely be in this environment.
I hope that the sincerity of my gratitude is clearly expressed to them- yes you.


Im processing everything that comes down the pike as a positive enhancement or refelction or valued point to be taken I've really started to let go of feeling bad -im
Here for me- do I wish I could help the others in the class? of course.. yes I do- 

If I knew more useful js, css, and html, I would feel more comfortable when I was there... more
Myself... and I can safely predict with the utmost accuracy that I would proactively be helping the ppl
That I see that may be struggling from time to time as well- I don't know how
I would be able to reciprocate to those that I've helped me after this is over but if I get the chance to I will.

**Joseph heller -skelter--**I think I'm adopting the HW writing style in my journal- "run we are under attack!!" Lol
So... I come in behind and I need a little help-- i get a tutor so that I can better complete my HW -only thing is -the Tutor takes up most of my early evening after 5 and by the time I get home I need at least 30 min just to stare and hopefully hang out with my little girl- so I end up staying up late - which is okay but not 5 days a week- I've made some adjustments that should help this situation -stay tuned -
more thoughts-

**If first you don't succeed 
Try at least 9,999 times more ....**
<break>
I know that it will remain tough and even exponentially tough for me as the weeks progress but I am doing what I can to mitigate that down to normal level of torture, pain, misery, and fear. ;)
This week some bulbs started to blink ..on- a couple flickered again but It's a process right?
Maybe even 2 steps forward 2 steps back for a bit --which is way better than 4 steps back..
The day we started talking about the MVC it really struck home- it really got me enthused about what we are learning on a larger scale---The thread that binds the CSS with the html is just presently being woven --the js i mean-

So the MVC I understood-
At one point the HW from the night before was instantly more clear- David asked what the test file was in the HW in other words :what part of the MVC relationship/interaction/nexus- would the test file be used in place of:(?) I knew the answer-the View..of course the main output...yes? yes?
Of course I didn't say it but that doesn't matter as much as the fact that I knew the answer- not BC I was cataloging definitions but BC I suddenly heard it and saw

It through a less filtered view- so im very confident about using this as the ground work for any website project. 
We also learned about SASS which I haven't been exploring or using enough- but I do understand it's function but I'm
Not there yet- I haven't used it enough ---but I will---oh ..I will
<break>
Jquery -the JavaScript library carrying tons of useful and more efficiently deployed JavaScript functions neatly wrapped and ready to change your script document- patience this will come grasshopper I mean lotus brain:
It almost seems like I can't start using jquery effectively -implementing it in any effective way before I understand the engine -the js

I have done a considerable amount of reading about this and my concept is better than vague but I would say -that a working knowledge of it is right behind a better level of JavaScript comprehension- 
It seems like it wants me to learn it- I don't understand why learning in a vacuum -im other words not scrambling to find the answer to solve a real life time crunch-has been this slow for me- 
<break>

So at the end of the week the chessboard exercise came as well as the Wizards tasks of repopulating the tympanus blueprints with js let alone jquery- I didn't reach this point-
<break>

But, I did have a personal goal met, and I was able to construct the board on my own using arrays with arrays-
I didn't look at the arrays on the assignment readme and as I was placing the last empty row of arrays for the middle of the board,,I wondered how one should display the moves? is it a reinstantiation of the the html doc in the dom or does the board remain static and the pieces move almost on another type of index layer...is this crazy?? don't answer.
This concept is very attractive to me- it reminds me of fractal geometry in the sense that it can forever nest deeper within itself-
Im not sure if there is an Actual limit to this since we now rely so prevalently on virtual servers whos memory capacity seems to be boundless- I wonder what the deepest level of arrays or lists and dictionaries or just nested elements in general, actually is(¿)
Note to self - look this up in 6 weeks :)
Things are looking better and more bulbs are turning on day by day. I think it is just a matter of exposure.
