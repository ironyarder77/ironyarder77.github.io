he Right Mindset: Reflections on Carol Dweck's Motivation Research & The Power of "Yet"
The concept of adopting a "non-fixed" or fluid, adaptive mindset rather than a "fixed", or rigid the conveyed by Stanford Researcher, Carol Dweck, aka "the mindset lady". The "Yet" concept came about while Carol Dweck was observing a schoolroom, where, instead of students receiving an "F", the teacher would write "Not Yet". This psychologically transmits to the student that learning is a process of confronting unfamiliar territory, experimenting with ways of illuminating the situation, struggling with the unfamiliar, but all the while approaching it not with fear or pre-emptive anxiety, but with the joy of confronting an exciting challenge. A challenge, who's outcome does not set the child's ego and self image towar

The Stanford researcher's subjects were elementary school children from failing school systems, some substandard schools, such as a school in the Bronx, NY, and groups who have unfortunately acquired the socio-academic stigma of being "under achievers" or inherently cut off from higher learning by an expectation of failure. The "yet" concept is used to describe a certain way of positive reinforcement devoid of finite labels such as "Fail". Instead, children were told that if they keep practicing what they are learning. math skills, for instance, their brains, although initially terrified of the challenges, begins to actually develop new pathways of growth.
