My tutorial for week four will be concerned with creating a chessboard using nothing but arrays.
This tutorial will attempt to show the method of creating only one part of the process entailed when creating a chessboard in html and/ or javascript.

 The are like vast cotainers, or rather they can be vast. Arrays can also contain other arrays.
 Which, in and of itself, is a very interesting topic.
